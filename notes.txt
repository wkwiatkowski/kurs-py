1. What does mean %s
The %s token allows me to insert (and potentially format) a string. Notice that the %s token is replaced by whatever I pass to the string after the % symbol. Notice also that I am using a tuple here as well (when you only have one string using a tuple is optional) to illustrate that multiple strings can be inserted and formatted in one statement.

"Hello %s, my name is %s" % ('john', 'mike') # Hello john, my name is mike".
"My name is %s and i'm %d" % ('john', 12) #My name is john and i'm 12

'%s' indicates a conversion type of 'string' when using python's string formatting capabilities. More specifically, '%s' converts a specified value to a string using the str() function. Compare this with the '%r' conversion type that uses the repr() function for value conversion.
